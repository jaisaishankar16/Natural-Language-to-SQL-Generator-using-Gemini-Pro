**Problem Statement:**

The problem statement of this project is to develop a chatbot-like application that can retrieve SQL queries from a SQLite database based on the user's input. The application uses the Google Gemini Pro model to generate the SQL queries and then executes them on the database to retrieve the desired data.

**Dependencies and Requirements:**

To run this project, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

* `streamlit`: A Python library for building web applications.
* `google.generativeai`: A Python library for using Google's Generative AI models.
* `sqlite3`: A Python library for working with SQLite databases.
* `constants`: A Python file containing a constant variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY` which is used to configure the Google Gemini Pro model.

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```
pip install streamlit google.generativeai sqlite3
```
**Commands to Download Requirements:**

You can download the dependencies using the following commands:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Code Walkthrough and Explanation:**

The code is divided into three main files: `app.py`, `constants.py`, and `sql.py`.

**app.py:**

* The file starts by importing the necessary libraries and configuring the Google Gemini Pro model using the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` constant.
* The `get_gemini_response` function is used to generate the SQL query based on the user's input and a predefined prompt.
* The `read_sql_query` function is used to execute the generated SQL query on the SQLite database and retrieve the desired data.
* The `prompt` list contains a predefined text that is used to prompt the user and generate the SQL query.
* The `streamlit` library is used to create a web application that takes user input and displays the retrieved data.

**constants.py:**

* This file contains a constant variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY` which is used to configure the Google Gemini Pro model.

**sql.py:**

* This file contains the code to create a SQLite database and insert some sample records into it.
* The `create_table` function creates a table named `STUDENT` with four columns: `NAME`, `CLASS`, `SECTION`, and `MARKS`.
* The `insert_records` function inserts some sample records into the `STUDENT` table.
* The `display_records` function retrieves all the records from the `STUDENT` table and prints them.

**Solution and Code Explanation:**

The solution achieved by this code is to create a chatbot-like application that can retrieve SQL queries from a SQLite database based on the user's input. The application uses the Google Gemini Pro model to generate the SQL queries and then executes them on the database to retrieve the desired data.

The code uses the `streamlit` library to create a web application that takes user input and displays the retrieved data. The `get_gemini_response` function is used to generate the SQL query based on the user's input and a predefined prompt. The `read_sql_query` function is used to execute the generated SQL query on the SQLite database and retrieve the desired data.

**Final Command to Run the Program:**

To run the program, you can use the following command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
This will start the web application and you can access it by visiting `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

**Gemini App to Retrieve SQL Data**
===============================

**Problem Statement**
-------------------

The Gemini App is designed to convert English questions into SQL queries and retrieve data from a SQLite database. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for users to ask questions and receive relevant SQL responses.

**Dependencies and Requirements**
------------------------------

* Python 3.8+
* Streamlit (for building the web app)
* google.generativeai (for generating text responses)
* sqlite3 (for interacting with the SQLite database)
* constants.py (for storing the Google API key)

**Project Structure**
--------------------

The project consists of the following files and folders:

* `app.py`: Main application file containing the Streamlit app and logic for generating responses and querying the database.
* `constants.py`: File containing the Google API key.
* `sql.py`: File containing the SQLite database connection and operations.
* `student.db`: SQLite database file containing the STUDENT table.

**How to Run**
------------

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install streamlit google-api-python-client`.
3. Set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable or update the `constants.py` file with your own API key.
4. Run the Streamlit app by executing `streamlit run app.py`.
5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.
6. Enter a question in the text input field and click the "Ask the question" button.
7. The app will generate a SQL response and display the results.

**Ideology and Solution**
-------------------------

The Gemini App uses the Google Gemini model to generate text responses to user questions. The app then parses the response to extract the SQL query and executes it on the SQLite database. The results are displayed to the user in a user-friendly format.

**Technologies Used**
--------------------

* Streamlit (for building the web app)
* Google Gemini model (for generating text responses)
* SQLite (for storing and querying the database)
* Python 3.8+
